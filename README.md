## Introduction
The Gym Management System is a powerful web application developed using Django that simplifies the management of a gym facility. This comprehensive system allows gym managers and employees to streamline their daily operations, enhance member experiences, and improve overall efficiency.
## Features
### Manager (Super User)
- **Employee Management**: The Manager, as a super user, can create and modify employee records. They have the authority to manage the employee database, including personal details, contact information, and job roles. This feature ensures smooth coordination and efficient management of the gym staff.
- **Equipment Management**: The Manager can create new equipment records, update existing ones, and maintain an accurate inventory. This feature enables better organization and maintenance of gym equipment, ensuring members have access to high-quality resources.
- **Gym Membership Packages**: The Manager can create customized gym membership packages to cater to diverse member needs. They can define packages, such as Basic, Premium, Student, and Individual, each with unique benefits and pricing options.
- **Schedule Management**: The Manager can create gym membership packages, and employees, and coach's schedules. This flexible scheduling feature optimizes resource allocation, facilitates efficient planning of workout sessions, and ensures a smooth flow of operations.
- **Salary Management**: The Manager can set and manage salaries for employees and coaches. This ensures accurate and timely compensation for staff members, fostering a positive work environment.
- **Dashboard**: The Manager can access a comprehensive dashboard providing an overview of the gym's records. They can view income and expense charts, and credit and debit transactions, and gain insights into the overall financial performance of the gym.
### Employee
- **User Authentication**: Employees can log in to the system using the credentials assigned by the Manager. This ensures secure access to the system and restricts unauthorized usage.
- **Attendance Management**: Employees can mark their attendance within their scheduled working hours. The Manager determines these schedules and assigns them to employees. Additionally, employees can mark attendance on behalf of coaches if they are present during the scheduled time.
- **Due Bill Collection**: Employees can collect due bills from gym members. During the collection process, the system verifies the member's profile status, ensuring it is active, and validates if the member is paying for the correct membership package.
- **Equipment Booking**: Employees can book equipment on behalf of gym members. The system validates the member's package details and checks if the equipment is included in their package. It also verifies if the booking schedule falls within the member's daily schedule as per their package.
- **Private Coach Session**: Employees can book private coach sessions for members. The system checks the booking price, where premium package members enjoy the booking fee of 200 Rupees, while others pay 400 Rupees. Additionally, the system checks if the selected coach has available and if the booking time is within the member's schedule.
